This is what I did for Installing Anaconda Python 3.6 version and Tensorflow on Window 10 64bit.And It was success!

1.Download Anaconda Python 3.6 version for Window 64bit.


2.Create a conda environment named tensorflow by invoking the following command:
C:> conda create -n tensorflow 


3.Activate the conda environment by issuing the following command:
C:> activate tensorflow
(tensorflow)C:>  # Your prompt should change 


4.Download ¡°tensorflow-1.0.1-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl¡± from here. (For my case, the file will be located in ¡°C:\Users\Joshua\Downloads¡± once after downloaded).


5.Install the Tensorflow by using following command:
(tensorflow)C:>pip install C:\Users\Joshua\Downloads\ tensorflow-1.0.1-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl


This is what I got after the installing: enter image description here

6.Validate installation by entering following command in your Python environment:
import tensorflow as tf
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(hello))


If the output you got is 'Hello, TensorFlow!',that means you have successfully install your Tensorflow.
